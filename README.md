# Drop-In-Drop-Out-Restaurant-Sales
Drop In Drop Out (DIDO) is a restaurant located in Gujranwala, Pakistan which is being run as a welfare project for the local community. As a data analyst, by leveraging the power of SQL queries I was able to gather insights from the data collected over approximately a one year period.

By extracting insights based on the total number of items sold based on rank of the individual, average items sold per transaction, the dates with the highest number of items sold and the top 8 items sold I was able to tailor the prices and introduce "deals" on items for the community. 

Below are the deals and offers that were devised based on the data.
